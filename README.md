# AI vs Human Text Generation Detector

This project uses a transformer-based BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to classify whether a given paragraph is AI-generated or human-written. The model is trained to understand the unique characteristics of both AI-generated and human-written text, making it capable of accurately distinguishing between the two.

## Features

- **Text Classification**: Classifies paragraphs as either AI-generated or human-written.
- **Transformer-based Model**: Utilizes a BERT model for deep understanding and classification of text.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple command-line interface for inputting paragraphs and getting results.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kaushal-kumar12/Human_vs_Machine_Text_Classifier_Using_Transformer_Models.git

### Key Points:
- **Google Drive Link**:  `https://drive.google.com/file/d/16rBSK8ezR-G4TselN0WbxE8iXGt04tC5/view?usp =drive_link` with your actual Google Drive link for the model.
- **Model Path=modle/bert_model**: After downloading and extracting the model, users will need to update the path in their script to point to the folder where they saved the model.

By following these steps, users will be able to download the model from Google Drive and use it in your project without any issues.
